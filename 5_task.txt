task

1. 
Given two integer numbers return their product only if the product is equal to or lower than 1000, else return their sum.

example: x = 30 , y =20 ..output = 600
	x = 40, y = 30 ...output = 70

2.

Write a program to iterate the first 10 numbers and in each iteration, print the sum of the current and previous number.
expected output : 
Printing current and previous number sum in a range(10)
Current Number 0 Previous Number  0  Sum:  0
Current Number 1 Previous Number  0  Sum:  1
Current Number 2 Previous Number  1  Sum:  3
Current Number 3 Previous Number  2  Sum:  5
Current Number 4 Previous Number  3  Sum:  7
Current Number 5 Previous Number  4  Sum:  9
Current Number 6 Previous Number  5  Sum:  11
Current Number 7 Previous Number  6  Sum:  13
Current Number 8 Previous Number  7  Sum:  15
Current Number 9 Previous Number  8  Sum:  17

3. 
Write a program to remove characters from a string starting from zero up to n and return a new string.
example :
("divyam", 2) so output must be vyam. Here we need to remove first two characters from a string

a = string
print= len = 6 
choose = 3
result = 3...

example:
a = "Divyam"
len()= 6
c = input = 2
result: 2...5 = 2345: vyam


4.
Write a program to accept a string from the user and display characters that are present at an even index number.

For example
Orginal String is  "divyam"
expected output : 
Printing only even index chars
d
v
a

5.

Write a function to return True if the first and last number of a given list is same. If numbers are different then return False.

example : Given list: [10, 20, 30, 40, 10]
result is True
